## Agents

- Use language models for intelligence, reasoning and planning
- Use tools to interact with external systems and the real world
- Use memory to remember past interactions and preferences
- Use knowledge to supplement their training data with domain expertise

## Example: Research Agent

Let's create an Agent that can help us research a topic by searching the web. We **"prompt"** the Agent using `description` and `instructions`, for example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Research Agent">
    Create a file `research_agent.py`

    ```python research_agent.py
    from ethosian.agent import Agent
    from ethosian.model.openai import OpenAIChat
    from ethosian.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo
    from ethosian.tools.newspaper4k import Newspaper4k

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGo(), Newspaper4k()],
        description="You are a senior NYT researcher writing an article on a topic.",
        instructions=[
            "For a given topic, search for the top 3 links.",
            "Then read each URL and extract the article text, if a URL isn't available, ignore and let it be.",
            "Analyse and prepare an NYT worthy article based on the information.",
        ],
        markdown=True,
        show_tool_calls=True,
        add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
        # debug_mode=True,
    )
    agent.print_response("Simulation theory", stream=True)
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install ethosian openai duckduckgo-search newspaper4k lxml_html_clean
    ```

    Run the agent

    ```shell
    python research_agent.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Under the hood, the description and instructions are converted to the system prompt and the input is passed as the user prompt. Use `debug_mode=True` to log the messages sent to the LLM.
</Note>

## Return Agent response as a variable

Use the `Agent.run()` function to capture the response as a variable.

```python
from ethosian.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from ethosian.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(...)

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response: RunResponse = agent.run("Simulation theory")
# Print the response in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

By default `stream=False`, set `stream=True` to return a stream.

```python
from typing import Iterator

# Run agent and return the response as a stream
response_stream: Iterator[RunResponse] = agent.run("Simulation theory", stream=True)
# Print the response stream in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response_stream, markdown=True, show_time=True)
```

## Run the agent as a CLI app

Run the agent as a command line application using `agent.cli_app()`

```python
from ethosian.agent import Agent
from ethosian.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo

agent = Agent(tools=[DuckDuckGo()], show_tool_calls=True, read_chat_history=True)
agent.cli_app(markdown=True)
```

Ask

```
Whats happening in france?
```

Then ask:

```
Summarize the last response
```

## Manually set the system prompt

You can manually set the system prompt using the `system_prompt` variable. The `description` and `instructions` only provide a formatting benefit. Learn more in the [prompts](/agents/prompts) guide.

```python
from ethosian.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(system_prompt="Share a 2 sentence story about")
agent.print_response("Love in the year 12000.")
```
