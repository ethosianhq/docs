Engineers use ethosian to:
- Build high-quality, personalized AI Agents with memory, knowledge and tools.
- Run these Agents as part of a software stack:
  - An API to serve the Agents (FastAPI)
  - A database to provide memory and storage (Postgres)
  - A vector db to store knowledge (PgVector)
- Monitor and test the Agents using the ethosian platform.

Together, these components form an agentic system that engineers use to build AI products.


## How it works

- **Step 1:** Create an `Agent` with memory, knowledge and tools.
- **Step 2:** Deploy using FastApi, Django or Streamlit to the cloud of your choice.
- **Step 3:** Monitor and improve using the ethosian platform.

- Memory: Stores chat history and user preferences in a database, enabling agents to have personalized, long-term conversations that persist across sessions.
- Knowledge: Stores domain-specific information in a vector database and provides agents with business context, tailoring their responses to our specific use-case.
- Tools: Enable agents to interact with external systems, like pulling data from an API, sending emails or querying a database. Tools integrate agents with the real world.
- **Memory:** Stores **chat history** and **user preferences** in a database, enabling agents to have personalized, long-term conversations that persist across sessions.
- **Knowledge:** Stores domain-specific information in a vector database and provides agents with **business context**, tailoring their responses to our specific use-case.
- **Tools:** Enable agents to interact with external systems, like pulling data from an API, sending emails or querying a database. Tools integrate agents with the real world by taking actions.

Memory & knowledge make agents **smarter** while tools make them **autonomous**.

## Example

### Build a Web Search Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a virtual environment">
    Open the `Terminal` and create a python virtual environment.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/aienv
    source ~/.venvs/aienv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    python3 -m venv aienv
    aienv/scripts/activate
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install ethosian">

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U ethosian
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U ethosian
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a web search agent">

    Create a file `web_search.py` with an agent that can search the web using DuckDuckGo.

    ```python agent.py
    from ethosian.agent import Agent
    from ethosian.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo

    agent = Agent(tools=[DuckDuckGo()], show_tool_calls=True, markdown=True)
    agent.print_response("Whats happening in France?", stream=True)
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">

    Agents use `OpenAI` by default. Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` (you can get one from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)).

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Install `openai` & `duckduckgo`

    ```shell
    pip install openai duckduckgo-search
    ```

    Run the agent

    ```shell
    python web_search.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Build a Finance Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a finance agent">

    Create a file `finance_agent.py`

    ```python finance_agent.py
    from ethosian.agent import Agent
    from ethosian.llm.openai import OpenAIChat
    from ethosian.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

    agent = Agent(
        llm=OpenAIChat(model="gpt-4o"),
        tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True)],
        show_tool_calls=True,
        markdown=True,
    )
    agent.print_response("What is the stock price of NVDA")
    agent.print_response("Write a comparison between NVDA and AMD, use all tools available.")
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">

    Install `yfinance`

    ```shell
    pip install yfinance
    ```

    Run the agent

    ```shell
    python finance_agent.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Looking to build an AI product?

We've helped many companies build AI products, the general workflow is:

1. **Build an Agent** with proprietary data to perform tasks specific to your product.
2. **Connect your product** to the Agent via an API.
3. **Monitor and Improve** your AI product.

We also provide dedicated support and development, [book a call](https://cal.com/ethosian/intro) to get started.
