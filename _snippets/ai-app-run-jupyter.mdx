## Optional: Run Jupyterlab

A jupyter notebook is a must have for AI development and your `ai-app` comes with a notebook pre-installed with the required dependencies. To start your notebook:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Jupyter">
    Update the `workspace/settings.py` file and set `dev_jupyter_enabled=True`

    ```python workspace/settings.py
    ...
    ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
        ...
        # Uncomment the following line
        dev_jupyter_enabled=True,
    ...
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Jupyter">

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash terminal
    ethosian ws up --group jupyter
    ```

    ```bash shorthand
    ethosian ws up dev:docker:jupyter
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    **Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

  </Step>
