## Test your Agents using Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) allows us to build micro front-ends for testing our Agents. Start the `app` using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
ethosian ws up --group app
```

```bash shorthand
ethosian ws up dev:docker:app
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

- Open [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to view your AI Agent.
- The streamlit apps are defined in the `app` folder
- The `Agents` are defined in the `agents` folder.
